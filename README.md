## Requirements

- Python 3.7.13
- torch 1.10.0
- torchvision 0.11.0
- ffmpeg

We conduct the experiments with 4 24G RTX3090 on CUDA 11.1. For more details, please refer to the `requirements.txt`. We recommend to install [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) firstly, and then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have trouble installing [lws](https://pypi.org/project/lws/), the following installation steps may help:

1. Make sure the Python version <= 3.8.6.
2. Install [lws](https://pypi.org/project/lws/), numpy, and scipy first.
3. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) <= 1.13.1.
4. Install other dependencies.
5. Replace `_2D` with `TWO_D` if there are errors regarding `face_alignment`.

## Test

Download the pre-trained models from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!Amqu9u09qiUGi7UJIADzCCC9rThkpQ?e=P1jG5N) or [jianguoyun](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DeXpK34QgZ-EChjI9YcFIAA), and place them to the folder `test/checkpoints` . Then run the following command:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python inference_single.py
```

To inference on other videos, please specify the `--input` and `--audio` option and see more details in code.

The evaluation code is similar to [this repo](https://github.com/dc3ea9f/vico_challenge_baseline/tree/a282472ea99a1983ca2ce194665a51c2634a1416/evaluations).

## Train

### Download LRS2 dataset

Our models are trained on LRS2. Please go to the [LRS2](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrs2.html) website to download the dataset. LRS2 dataset folder structure is following:

```
data_root (mvlrs_v1)
├── main, pretrain (we use only main folder in this work)
|	├── list of folders
|	│   ├── five-digit numbered video IDs ending with (.mp4)
```

`main folder` is the `lrs2_video` mentioned below.

### Preprocess the audio

Extract the raw audio and Mel-spectrum feature from video files by running:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python preprocess_audio.py --data_root ....../lrs2_video/ --out_root ..../lrs2_audio
```

### Preprocess the videos' face

Extract the cropped face, landmarks and sketches from video files by running:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python preprocess_video.py --dataset_video_root ....../lrs2_video/ --output_sketch_root ..../lrs2_sketch --output_face_root ..../lrs2_face --output_landmark_root ..../lrs2_landmarks
```

### Train Landmark generator

Train the landmark generator network by running:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_landmarks_generator.py --pre_audio_root ..../lrs2_audio --landmarks_root ..../lrs2_landmarks
```

The models are trained until the eval_L1_loss no longer decreases (about 6e-3).
Under the default batchsize setting on a single RTX 3090, our model stopped at epoch 1837(610k iteration) with eval_L1_loss 5.866 e-3, using no more than one day.

### Train Video Renderer

Training for the video renderer is similar (on four RTX 3090). Train it until the FID no longer decreases (about 20 or less).
train the video renderer network by running:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train_video_renderer.py --sketch_root ..../lrs2_sketch --face_img_root ..../lrs2_face  --audio_root ..../lrs2_audio
```

Note that the translation module will only be trained  after 25 epochs, thus the fid and running_gen_loss will only decrease after epoch 25.
